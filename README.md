# Landmark task


The following is a description of a classic behavioural task I made for a research project on visuospatial bias in human subjects.
This was utilized in a pilot experiment conducted during summer 2021 at this [lab](http://www.cognitiveneuroscience.it/?lang=en) in Brescia, Italy.


#### Brief background notes
The aim of this task is to evaluate the degree of bias while making a judgment on the length of two segments in a bisected line.
The following is a representation of the task sequence: the lines will stay on screen for a brief moment after which participants will give a response within 2 seconds.
