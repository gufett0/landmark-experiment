# landmark-experiment

The following is a description of two behavioural tasks I made for a research project on visuospatial bias in human subjects.
Both computer-based tasks were utilized in a pilot experiment conducted during summer 2021 at this lab in Brescia, Italy http://www.cognitiveneuroscience.it/?lang=en 


#### Landmark task
This was the main expertimental task whose results were logged as a primary measure. 


#### Orientation detection task
This task served as a control and needed to be matched for overall complexity. 


#### What is needed
Octave GNU and Psychtoolbox
